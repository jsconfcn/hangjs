  "readme": "# Metalsmith\n\nAn extremely simple, _pluggable_ static site generator.\n\nIn Metalsmith, all of the logic is handled by plugins. You simply chain them together. Here's what the simplest blog looks like...\n\n```js\nMetalsmith(__dirname)\n  .use(markdown())\n  .use(templates('handlebars'))\n  .build();\n```\n\n...but what if you want to get fancier by hiding your unfinished drafts and using custom permalinks? Just add plugins...\n\n```js\nMetalsmith(__dirname)\n  .use(drafts())\n  .use(markdown())\n  .use(permalinks('posts/:title'))\n  .use(templates('handlebars'))\n  .build();\n```\n\n...it's as easy as that!\n\n## Installation\n\n    $ npm install metalsmith\n\n## Plugins\n\nCheck out the website for a list of [plugins](http://www.metalsmith.io#the-plugins).\n\n## How does it work?\n\nMetalsmith works in three simple steps:\n\n  1. Read all the files in a source directory.\n  2. Invoke a series of plugins that manipulate the files.\n  3. Write the results to a destination directory!\n\nEach plugin is invoked with the contents of the source directory, and each file can contain YAML front-matter that will be attached as metadata, so a simple file like...\n\n    ---\n    title: A Catchy Title\n    date: 2014-12-01\n    ---\n    \n    An informative article.\n  \n  ...would be parsed into...\n\n```js\n{\n  'path/to/my-file.md': {\n    title: 'A Catchy Title',\n    date: new Date('2014-12-01'),\n    contents: new Buffer('An informative article.')\n  }\n}\n```\n\n...which any of the plugins can then manipulate however they want. And writing the plugins is incredibly simple, just take a look at the [example drafts plugin](examples/drafts-plugin/index.js).\n\nOf course they can get a lot more complicated too. That's what makes Metalsmith powerful; the plugins can do anything you want!\n\n## The secret...\n\nWe keep referring to Metalsmith as a \"static site generator\", but it's a lot more than that. Since everything is a plugin, the core library is actually just an abstraction for manipulating a directory of files.\n\nWhich means you could just as easily use it to make...\n\n  - [A simple project scaffolder.](examples/project-scaffolder)\n  - [A simple build tool for Sass files.](examples/build-tool)\n  - [A simple static site generator.](examples/static-site)\n  - [A Jekyll-like static site generator.](examples/jekyll)\n  - [A Wintersmith-like static site generator.](examples/wintersmith)\n\n## CLI\n\nIn addition to a simple [Javascript API](#api), the Metalsmith CLI can read configuration from a `metalsmith.json` file, so that you can build static-site generators similar to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) or [Wintersmith](http://wintersmith.io) easily. The example blog above would be configured like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"source\": \"src\",\n  \"destination\": \"build\",\n  \"plugins\": {\n    \"metalsmith-drafts\": true,\n    \"metalsmith-markdown\": true,\n    \"metalsmith-permalinks\": \"posts/:title\",\n    \"metalsmith-templates\": \"handlebars\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd then just install `metalsmith` and the plugins and run the metalsmith CLI...\n\n    $ node_modules/.bin/metalsmith\n      \n        Metalsmith · reading configuration from: /path/to/metalsmith.json\n        Metalsmith · successfully built to: /path/to/build\n\nOr if you install them globally, you can just use:\n\n    $ metalsmith\n      \n        Metalsmith · reading configuration from: /path/to/metalsmith.json\n        Metalsmith · successfully built to: /path/to/build\n\nCheckout the [static site](examples/static-site), [Jekyll](examples/jekyll) or [Wintersmith](examples/wintersmith) examples to see the CLI in action.\n\n## API\n\nCheckout the [project scaffolder](examples/project-scaffolder) or [build tool](examples/build-tool) examples to see a real example of the Javascript API in use.\n\n#### new Metalsmith(dir)\n\nCreate a new `Metalsmith` instance for a working `dir`.\n\n#### #use(plugin)\n\nAdd the given `plugin` function to the middleware stack.\n\n#### #build(fn)\n\nBuild with the given settings and call `fn(err, files)`.\n\n#### #source(path)\n\nSet the relative `path` to the source directory, or get the full one if no `path` is provided. The source directory defaults to `./src`.\n\n#### #destination(path)\n\nSet the relative `path` to the destination directory, or get the full one if no `path` is provided. The destination directory defaults to `./build`.\n\n#### #metadata(json)\n\nGet the global metadata. This is useful for plugins that want to set global-level metadata that can be applied to all files.\n\n#### #join(paths...)\n \nJoin any amount of `paths...` to the working directory. This is useful for plugins who want to read extra assets from another directory, for example `./templates`.\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright &copy; 2014, Segment.io \\<friends@segment.io\\>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
